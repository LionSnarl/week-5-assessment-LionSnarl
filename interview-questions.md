# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. Rails follows an MVC pattern. What does that mean?

  Your answer: Rails follows the pattern of MVC (Model, View, Controller); which means it comes default with a structure for a database (model), a web service (Controller), and for web pages(View). You can make a Full-Stack application solely through Rails because of this!

  Researched answer: Model, View, Controller is the pattern Ruby follows, which means it can be it's own full stack application that supplies the model (like a database), the controller (modify and update the databse), and the view (where users can interact with you application).



2. What does it mean if an application has CRUD? What does CRUD stand for?

  Your answer: If an application has CRUD, I can assume it automatically has a persistent storage system, which means it can Create data, Read data, Update data, and Delete data (C.R.U.D.). CRUD is the bare minimum required to create a persistent storage system.  

  Researched answer: If an application has CRUD, it essentially means that it has the capabilities to have a persistent storage system. So you can Create, Read, Update, and Delete items inside a persistent storage system which is the minimum capabilities required to have a persistent storage system.



3. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

  Your answer: A relational database is a form of database that holds information in tables consisting of rows and columns. The information is stored to show relationships between sets of data inside the rows and columns. There are many different types of databases, some do not follow how the data is related to each other and they do not have to consist of rows and columns.

  Researched answer: Relational databases are a type of database that throw pieces of data that are related to each other onto a table designed with columns and rows. There are many kinds of databases, and you can build them to suit your needs.



4. What are the 5 HTTP verbs? What are they important?

  Your answer: Post, Get, Put & Patch, and Delete. These are methods to enact HTTP's form of C.R.U.D operations, which stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete.. These are the essential dynamics of creating a persistent storage system, or creating a website that is capable of holding & manipulating data. So, Post would refer to Creating a website, Get would refer to Reading, Put and Patch refer to Updating, and Delete is to Delete/Destroying.

  Researched answer: Post, get, put & patch, and delete are the minimal necessary methods that are required to create a full stack web application. They are used to Create, Read, Update, and Delete data from a persistent storage system that a web application is using. It is the only way to manipulate and handle the data a website deals with.



5. What is object-relational mapping?

  Your answer: This is a tool used to interact with incompatible data types using Object-Oriented programming languages. So, in Rails, Active Record is an ORM tool used convert data types and interact with them since they are incompatible and the only way to convert data between incompatible systems.

  Researched answer: Object-raltional mapping is a tool that developers use to interact and convert data between incompatible systems using Object-Oriendted programming languages. It enables developers to work with data that is incompatible with each other.



6. What is a gem?

  Your answer: Gems essentially are Ruby applications that help extend the capabilities of Ruby, so you can have a gem that runs tests for you like RSPEC.

  Researched answer: Gems are a library of code functionality. So they package up Ruby code to make it simple to share with others and they help extend or modify the functionality of ruby applications.



7. What are primary keys? Why are they important?

  Your answer: Primary keys are sort of like ID tags that are used to help identify every row of data. So they are sort of like unique identifiers that help pinpoint exact data sets inside a database. They are important because there could be many first and last names in a data base, but they are all associated with a single primary key to refer to.

  Researched answer: Primary keys are important because they are unique identifiers designated to identify each table record. They are important because sets of data can be assigned a single row and all pieces of data that are related to each other can all be identified by a primary key. They are like social security numbers in the United States, so with my name Ryan Sarll, or with another name like Jose Gonzales, there is probably more than one person in the US named our names, so we are given SSN's, or Primary Keys, to refer to us as individuals that contain all our relevant data.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.
- RESTful routes: Representational State Transfer. This is a pattern to follow when structuring routes between the server and the client.
- JSON: Stands for JavaScript Object Notation, and they are a lightweight data-interchange format. So they are easy for humans to read and write and they are easy for machines to parse and generate. They help store and transmit data objects that can consist of attribute value pairs and array data types.
- Endpoints: endpoints are essentially the start or the finish of the line of communication between systems. So the place that an API send requests and where the resource lives are called an endpoint
- Strong params: These are features that prevent assigning requests parameters to object unless they have explicit permission to change or assign request parameters
- Validations: They are used to ensure that only valid data is saved in the database.
